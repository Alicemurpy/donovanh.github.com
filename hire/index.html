    <p>Your website is important. As well as working in all browsers and devices, you need to use all available channels to reach your customers. This could mean establishing yourself as a thought leader through writing and teaching, or even reaching your users through conversations. You need your products to be fast, easy to use and reliable.</p>

    <h2>I can help.</h2>

    <p>I'm a seasoned <strong>front-end developer</strong>, with demonstrated skills in design, user experience, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (both in-browser and NodeJS).</p>
