    <p>Your website is important. As well as working in all browsers and devices, you need to use all available channels to reach your customers. This could mean establishing yourself as a thought leader through writing and teaching, or even reaching your users through conversations. You need your products to be fast, easy to use and reliable.</p>

    <h2>I can help.</h2>

    <p>I'm a seasoned <strong>front-end developer</strong>, with skills in design, user experience, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (both in-browser and NodeJS).</p>

    <p>I also write and teach on technical subjects, and am currently most involved in <a href="https://cssanimation.rocks">CSS Animation</a>, styleguide development, and generally designing and building for the web.</p>

    <p>I have written tutorials for many popular outlets, including <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/12/a-better-404-page/">Smashing Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.creativebloq.com/3d/how-create-impressive-3d-graphics-css3-21410672">Net magazine</a> and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/inspire/2013/11/3d-css.html">Adobe Inspire</a>.</p>

    <p>I have spoken on such topics as <a href="/talks/css-animation/">CSS Animation</a>, <a href="/talks/angular-intro/">AngularJS</a>, and <a href="/talks/node-intro/">Node.js</a>.</p>

    <p>Currently I am working with <a href="https://ti.to">Tito</a> on implementing front-end styleguides, as well as engineering and delivering an exceptional UX throughout. I am also redesigning and rebuilding one of Ireland's more popular online stores, and creating NodeJS-based bots that run on Slack.</p>

    <p>My work is the front-end development between design and server code and I love working on interesting, challenging projects that help people. Here are <a href="/portfolio/">some examples of my previous work</a>.</p>

    <p>I'd love to hear from you. Let's discuss how I can help you with your projects.</p>
