Ideal project! Wow - Iâ€™d imagine one where I get to collaborate to build a web app or site that includes animation, responsive design, and includes user testing and design iterations that improve the polish over time resulting in something that makes people really *happy* to use. I guess applying some of the tech demos I build on cssanimation.rocks with something more substantial - where I could combine the performance of CSS/JS animations with showing the right information at the right time.
