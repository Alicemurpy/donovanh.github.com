          <h1>Background</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            First, a bit about me. I'm a front-end developer. My day job exposes me to all sorts of cool and interesting technologies, SASS, server-side JavaScript, static website generators, rails apps and more. I also spend a fair amount of time thinking about usability, and how interact with web apps.

            Outside of work, I like to create small, and mostly useless, web projects to try out ideas. Often things I've learned from these projects find their way into my day to day work, sometimes not, but it's a fun way to make sure I keep learning.

            What I'm going to talk about this evening is a little different from what this meetup's name might suggest. I'm not going to talk about JavaScript. Instead, I'm going to talk a bit about a subject I find fun, namely using CSS for transitions and animations.

          <h1>Enough about me</h1>
          <aside class="notes">
            First, can I get a show of hands. Who here creates or plays a part in creating user interfaces? OK. Say you're moving some stuff around on the screen. Who's used JavaScript to achieve this? I certainly have. I still do. However what I'd like to present this evening is how you can get better performance, better separation of logical and presentation code, and achieve more interesting effects by using CSS instead.

            Oh by the way, who's used CSS for their UI transitions? Good, glad to see a few have already! I hope there's something of use in this talk.

            If anyone wants to ask a question at any point, please go ahead. Sometimes the moment can be lost if you want till the end, and I'm happy to talk more on any subject, or be corrected.

            So, what do I mean when I talk about using transitions and animations.

            Animation can look great. But it can also have practical uses, making interactions easier and more meaningful. When a block of content slides into the screen, we're programmed to notice. Using animation to change the state of something on the screen is much easier to notice than a sudden state change. Showing content sliding out of another area can draw attention to the content's source, and by implication can help demonstrate a page's structure.

          <h1>Transitions</h1>
          <img src="/talks/css-animation/images/atob.png" style="border: none; box-shadow: none; background: none !important" />
          <aside class="notes">
            Transitions are in themselves quite straightforward. By adding a line of SASS, or a few lines of vendor-prefixed CSS, you tell the browser to calculate the difference between two states and fill in the various key frames in between.

            When I say different states, this could be a hover state, or it could be the addition or removal of a class using JavaScript. A CSS transition can take place on a specific aspect of the object, such as it's colour, border radius, padding or size. It can also be used to simply transition everything at once by specifying "all".

            Here's an illustration of some transitions, starting with how it can be done with JavaScript.

            Physical objects move and react in predictable ways. We can tap into these learned associations by creating content that emulates some of these ideas. It stimulates our imagination and gives extra depth and character to what would otherwise be static and less interesting.
            The example here is the logo from hop.ie. It's created entirely in HTML and CSS. The animation is handled by a set of keyframes, shown here.

            It's possible to do all sorts of careful DOM manipulation with JS, but the main argument for moving the animations and transitions layer to CSS is that it's closer to the hardware. CSS is able to make use of hardware acceleration, and can result in smoother transitions on smaller devices such as phones. As well as this, CSS has been introducing several powerful tools to manupulate how things move and transition on screen.

            I'm not advocating ditching JS in favour of CSS only. JavaScript does things CSS cannot, such as attaching event listeners. These work well when used to add or remove classes from page elements, and use CSS to handle the visual changes.

            Describe what's being shown in the illustration. Open beta.hop.ie and show it in action. Explain how JS is being used to manage the list of albums, and apply the class "current", "next" and "previous". CSS takes over and animates the in-between frames. It's also used for the background image. The CSS transition is applied to the background image so that when the source is changed, it transitions. Explain how performance was initially very bad using (TRBL) positioning. But when the positioning was done using Translate3D, it made better use of the hardware.

              <li>Use prefixes</li>

            </ul>
          <aside class="notes">
            The hopper logo I used on hop.ie is currently broken in many browsers. Opera, Firefox and Safari have their own quirks, but the biggest one to be aware of is any version of Internet Explorer prior to v9 or so. Rather than detect browser vendor and present different content, I'm using modernizr to detect the browser's capability. When the page loads, the Modernizr JS detects whether the browser can support animation, and adds a class to the head of the document. The CSS then shows the animated area if this class is available, otherwise it uses a background PNG.
            
            It's important to keep fallbacks in mind when using CSS transitions. It's often a judgement call though. When animation is used to provide, like in the hopper example, entertainment value only, then it's not such a big deal if it doesn't work in older browsers. However if you're using animation to draw attention to elements or provide usability benefits, it might be worth looking into using some better supported CSS properties as a fallback.

            On an optimistic note though, Chrome has just dropped the "-webkit-transitions" prefix! Support is improving and will continue to do so. When the likes of Chrome drop their prefix, it's a sign that the property is considered stable.
            
            Depending on your audience, transitions might be perfectly good to use. However there will always be larger organisations, or in some cases geographical requirements that impact whether you'll want to rely on a modern CSS3 technique, but as front end engineers that's an ongoing consideration. Over the next few years we'll see less of IE8 and the likes, but we'll also need to be aware of how people use phones on mobile devices. But that's another talk.

            CSS transitions and animations are smooth, backed up by hardware support, and contain a growing set of features that make them useful across wider applications. Plus, maybe it's just me but I feel better moving display concerns such as transitions and on-screen movement into the CSS. It feels like the right place.
