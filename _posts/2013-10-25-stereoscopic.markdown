For a while I've been blogging about making all sorts of 3D-style effects using CSS. In this post I take it one step further and try to make the scenes look **even more three dimensional**.

## Stereoscopes

There are many techniques used to try to convey a 3D image from a screen. One of the oldest is the use of red and green (or blue) coloured film, which when watched through red/green glasses produces a 3D effect.

[Simurai](http://twitter.com/simurai) has put some work into this and created a nice [CSS3D](http://simurai.com/post/802968365/css3d-css3-3d-text) plugin to achieve it.

The downside to this is that the film can only be monochrome, as the colours are limited to being used to create the 3D effect.

### Side-by-side stereoscopy

A second approach to presenting 3D is to make use of an ability some of have to cross our eyes. The idea is to present two scenes side by side, each presented from a slightly different angle. If the viewer can cross their eyes, the two images combine to create a 3D effect.

While this may not work for everyone, it's great when it works and doesn't limit the number of colours a scene can include. Some [photographs show this effect](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ytf/5557882900/) nicely.

To give it a go, try looking at the following image from about two feet away from your monitor. Gently cross your eyes until the two images merge together, and if you get them to line up just right, it should look like it's 3D.

Let's see if we can create this effect using nothing but some HTML and CSS.

## Warning

Just a heads up, but if you are going to spend a lot of time staring at the screen with your eyes crossed, you might experience headaches. I know I did. Totally worth it though!

## Set the scene

To get started we'll create a simple 3D scene using some HTML.
