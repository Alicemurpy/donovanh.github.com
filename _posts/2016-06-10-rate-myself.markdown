This is part 3 of a series of homework challenges from [Seth Godin's Freelancer Course](https://www.udemy.com/seth-godin-freelancer-course/learn/v4/). In this post I'll rate my abilities.

I have to admit, this is a little daunting. I will try to be honest and avoid as much Dunning Kruger as I can.

## Compared to others who do what you do, rank yourself on: reputation, knowledge, expertise, tools, handiness.

Ok let's try this.

### Reputation

**5** /10

I think I've created a bit of reputation. Between writing for magazines, creating and launching [CSS Animation](https://cssanimation.rocks) and other writing, I've definitely created something. I've worked in a few jobs over the past years that have helped me learn loads and will continue to do so, but I feel there's room to improve in how I approach solving problems with people. That's something I want to work on.

### Knowledge

**7** /10

I feel pretty confident that I've a decent amount of knowledge. It's a little arbitrary putting a number on such a moving target, but I try to keep up with trends to some extent and enjoy learning new things. This year's focus on JavaScript has really helped me understand how lots of systems work together, such as NodeJS and working with the DOM.

My knowledge of CSS is not 100% but I'm always using and improving that, and doing my best to keep up with the industry trends around Sass, building large scale maintainable CSS architectures, and fun stuff such as Flexbox and CSS shapes.

### Expertise

**7** /10

I'm not entirely sure how this differs from knowledge. Maybe there's some nuance I'm missing. I imagine that one way expertise might differ is in the application of knowledge to problem solving. I'm lucky enough to have worked with many inspiring and expert colleagues in my career, and I think that's given me some expertise in applying my craft.

### Tools

**7** /10

It doesn't take much to create for the web - a fast test editor, and the knowledge of how to dig through a web inspector to find and debug issues will get you pretty far. Knowing what to Google is sometimes half the battle though, and using online services that save time is good also.

Having spent years managing my own servers, DNS registries and basically building all along the tech stack, I'd say I'm pretty good at using the tools available. Still, there's definitely more to learn.

### Handiness

**6** /10

I'm pretty good at being available when needed, but maybe not quite as much as I used to be. Having a family, kids and other obligations has meant taking a proactive role in managing these things.

## Which will you invest in developing?

I'm always investing in developing my knowledge. I have several side projects on the go at any time, and read a bunch of weekly newletters related to HTML, tools, CSS and design. I have no plans to change this.

But I plan to put more time into Reputation and Expertise. The first by sharing more through the likes of the CSS Animation project, taking part in meetups and events, and being a helpful member of this community. The second by applying myself as intently as I can to my work. I learn something new in every job or project.
