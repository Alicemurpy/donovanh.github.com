    <p><strong>Update:</strong> I am currently available. <a href="mailto:d@hop.ie">Get in touch</a> if you have a project you'd like my help with.</p>

    <p>Today's web requires more than technical implementation. You need your products to be fast, easy to use and reliable, and to provide a great experience for each of your customers.</p>

    <h2>I can help.</h2>

    <p>I'm a seasoned <strong>front-end developer</strong> (15+ years experience), with skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (both in-browser and NodeJS) and delivering a great user experience.</p>

    <p>Currently I am working with <a href="https://ti.to">Tito</a>, implementing front-end styleguides as well as front-end engineering. I am also redesigning and rebuilding one of Ireland's more popular online stores, and creating NodeJS-based bots that run on Slack.</p>

    <p>My work is the front-end development between design and server code and I love working on interesting, challenging projects that help people. Here are <a href="/portfolio/">some examples of my previous work</a>.</p>
