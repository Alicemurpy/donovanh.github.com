The best error page is no error page, so let's apply that to our 404 pages.

Intro: 404 wankery is great and all but when a user arrives at a page and we don't have a page ready, it doesn't actually *help* them to show a funny animated gif. Rather than spend so much time wondering how to make something amusing and viral, we should be making our 404 pages as invisible as possible.

Labelling them 404... why

Providing links to possible alteratives... a decent last resort

Ideal solution: Service that indexes and searches, and comes up with a "best guess" and redirects the user there (with a message?)

Actual solutions: Some techniques that could work for static sites, etc.
